You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution; this simply
gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the
project.

If you or your current employer have already signed the Google CLA (even if it

### Review our community guidelines

This project follows
[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google/conduct/).

## Contribution workflow

### Generate Protobuf Code

```bash
make proto
```

### Run Tests

```bash
make test
```

### Run local agent

```bash
make run-local
```

### Install the gar CLI

```bash
make install
```

Ensure that $GOPATH/bin is in your $PATH.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

If you have the `GOBIN` environment variable set, it will be installed there instead.
Make sure the installation directory is in your `$PATH`.

To add the default location to your `PATH` for the current session, run:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

### Creating a pull request

First, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:google-gemini/gar.git
```

If you already have cloned the repo locally, make sure that
your main branch is up to date:

```
git checkout main
git pull -q -r origin main
```

Check a new feature branch:

```
git checkout -b my-feature
```

Make edits to files, and test them locally. Add the changes (e.g. git add .) to stage.
Commit the changes once you staged the changes:

```
git commit -m "Describe he changes made"
```

Push the branch to the origin and open a pull request:

```
git push origin my-feature
```
